# Unit Tests for VsftpdFTPSSimplifier

This document provides an overview of the unit tests implemented for the `VsftpdFTPSSimplifier` project. The tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the tool's core functionalities.

## Overview

The unit tests are written using Python's `unittest` framework and cover the following key functionalities of the `VsftpdFTPSSimplifier` tool:

- Installation of `vsftpd`.
- Generation of SSL certificates.
- Configuration of the `vsftpd` service.
- Management of the `vsftpd` service (restart).
- Verification of port listening.
- Logging and error handling.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure the following:

- Python 3.x is installed.
- The `unittest` module is available (it is included by default in Python's standard library).
- Mocking dependencies like `unittest.mock` are available.

## Running the Tests

To execute the unit tests, navigate to the `config` directory and run the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest test_vsftpd_ftps_config.py
```

This will run all the test cases defined in the `test_vsftpd_ftps_config.py` file.

## Test Coverage

### Test Cases

1. **Installation of `vsftpd`**:
   - Verifies that the `install_vsftpd()` function correctly executes the required system commands to install `vsftpd`.

2. **SSL Certificate Generation**:
   - Tests the `generate_ssl_cert()` function to ensure it generates SSL certificates and private keys with the correct parameters.

3. **Configuration of `vsftpd`**:
   - Ensures the `configure_vsftpd()` function creates and writes the correct configuration file for `vsftpd`.

4. **Service Management**:
   - Tests the `restart_vsftpd()` function to verify that the `vsftpd` service is restarted successfully.

5. **Port Listening Check**:
   - Verifies that the `check_port_listening()` function correctly identifies if `vsftpd` is listening on the specified port.

### Mocking

The tests use the `unittest.mock` module to mock system-level commands and file operations. This ensures that the tests do not make actual changes to the system during execution.

### Logging Test Results

The test suite includes a summary of test results at the end of execution, displaying the test name and its result (PASS/FAIL).

## Example Output

When the tests are executed, the output will indicate the status of each test case:

```plaintext
Running Test 1: test_install_vsftpd
Running Test 2: test_generate_ssl_cert
Running Test 3: test_configure_vsftpd
Running Test 4: test_restart_vsftpd
Running Test 5: test_check_port_listening

Summary of Test Results:
No.  Test Name                     Result
----------------------------------------------
1    test_install_vsftpd           PASS
2    test_generate_ssl_cert        PASS
3    test_configure_vsftpd         PASS
4    test_restart_vsftpd           PASS
5    test_check_port_listening     PASS
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Test Failures**: If a test fails, review the error message to identify the issue. Ensure that the mocked dependencies are correctly set up.
- **Permission Issues**: Some tests may require elevated privileges. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the tests.

## Contributing

If you add new features to the `VsftpdFTPSSimplifier` tool, ensure that corresponding unit tests are added to maintain test coverage. Follow the existing test structure and use mocking where necessary.
